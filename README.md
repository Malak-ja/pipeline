Pipeline
The five-stage pipeline in a 32-bit MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor is a fundamental concept in computer architecture. It divides the execution of instructions into five distinct stages, each handling a specific part of instruction processing. These stages are:

Instruction Fetch (IF):
Fetches the instruction from memory using the current program counter (PC).
The PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.
The fetched instruction is stored in an instruction register for decoding.
Instruction Decode (ID):
Decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved.
Reads the register file to obtain operand values.
Calculates branch targets if the instruction is a branch or jump.
Execute (EX):
Executes arithmetic and logic operations or calculates memory addresses.
For branch instructions, evaluates branch conditions and determines whether to take the branch.
Memory Access (MEM):
Accesses memory if necessary, typically for load and store operations.
For loads, retrieves data from memory.
For stores, writes data to memory.
Write Back (WB):
Writes the results of the instruction execution back to the register file.
For load instructions, writes the loaded data to the destination register.
In a pipelined processor, each stage operates concurrently on different instructions, allowing for higher throughput and better performance compared to non-pipelined architectures. While one instruction is being executed, the next instruction can be fetched, decoded, and so on. This overlapping of instruction processing stages improves overall processor efficiency.

However, pipelining introduces challenges such as hazards, which occur when the execution of one instruction depends on the result of another instruction still in progress. These hazards must be managed through techniques like forwarding, stalling, or branch prediction to maintain correct program behavior and maximize pipeline utilization.
